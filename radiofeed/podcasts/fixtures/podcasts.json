      "description": "What's CODE SWITCH? It's the fearless conversations about race that you've been waiting for! Hosted by journalists of color, our podcast tackles the subject of race head-on. We explore how it impacts every part of society — from politics and pop culture to history, sports and everything in between. This podcast makes ALL OF US part of the conversation — because we're all part of the story. \"We're talking to people who have been marginalized and underrepresented for so long, who are so hungry to see themselves represented fully and with nuance and complexity,\" says Shereen Marisol Meraji, co-host of Code Switch, Apple Podcasts' first-ever Show of the Year for 2020. \"People recognize that, because we had been having these conversations for so many years in advance, we're a trusted place where they could go to better understand all the stories about race filling up their newsfeeds and social channels.\" Their weekly podcast launched in 2016 but truly came into its own during this historic, transformative year, as Meraji and co-host Gene Demby examine issues of racial, ethnic, and cultural identity through frank one-on-one discussions and incisive non-fiction. In a year dominated by discourse about race, this indispensable show furthered them by providing powerful and timely insight, offering diverse and empathetic personal perspectives to a broad audience. \"There are certain lenses that we are bringing into, both as journalists and the people that we're bringing to these stories,\" Demby says. \"But also, we are specific people with specific fascinations and broad curiosity. If we're telling these stories, you should assume that they're going to look and sound like us.\"",

The fourth season of Slate’s Slow Burn will explore how a Nazi sympathizer and former Klansman fashioned himself into a mainstream figure, and why some voters came to embrace his message. It will also examine how activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens confronted Duke’s candidacy, and what it took to stop him.",

That’s right, this podcast will cover six different series and 30 seasons of television by journeying into every one of the 726 episodes with a single mission: to explore, debate and discuss one of the largest science fiction phenomena of all time, Star Trek. \n\nStarting with The Original Series’ initial pilot and continuing chronologically until we reach the last episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, each week our hosts, Ken Ray and John Champion, will tackle a single episode, delving into the most historical and hysterical science fiction that Star Trek has to offer.  Along with a variety of guests and interviews, Mission Log will attempt to reach Star Trek’s ethical subtext, understand it’s complex metaphors and finally figure out what was the trouble with those tribbles.\n\nExplore strange new details.  Seek out new perspectives; deeper understandings. Boldly go where so many of us love to go, again and again.  Join us for Mission Log!",

It’s about wild places, wild people, and wild ideas. Because whether it’s seeking out Bigfoot, in season one, or gazing skyward to look for extraterrestrial life in season two, the search for the unknown helps us better understand ourselves. Each week, host Laura Krantz takes us through the latest chapter, which builds on previous ones, so it’s best to start listening with Episode 1 of each season.

      "description": "The iFanboy.com Comic Book Podcast is a weekly talk show all about the best new current comic book releases. Lifelong friends, Conor Kilpatrick and Josh Flanagan talk about what they loved and (sometimes) hated in the current weekly books, from publishers like Marvel, DC, Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, BOOM! Studios, IDW, Aftershock, Valiant, and more. The aim is to have a fun time, some laughs, but to also really understand what makes comic books work and what doesn’t, and trying to understand the craft of this great, often under appreciated art form. Sometimes they agree, and sometimes… they don’t. With decades of experience talking about comics, interacting with comic book professionals, this is all about the love of an art form. If the names Brian Michael Bendis, Amanda Conner, Geoff Johns, Gene Luen Yang, Donny Cates, Jason Aaron, Kelly Thompson, David Marquez, Kelly Sue de Connick, Kieron Gillen, Charles Soule, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Scott Snyder, Tom King, Mitch Gerads, Esad Ribic, Rick Remender, Nick Spencer, John Ridley, Skottie Young, Chip Zdarsky, Jöelle Jones, David F. Walker, Grant Morrison, and Darwyn Cooke get you excited, then this is the place for you. This podcast is so good, you don’t even need to read comic books or graphic novels to enjoy it, but it’s a lot better if you do.",

Swearing is still fun, so we still do that occasionally. I hope you like this new iteration which is the same as before, but if a name hangs you up unhealthily I’m sure you will not hesitate to unfurl your rage not only in the ‘reviews’ section but also now on all the various social media platforms that have popped up since we started in 2010, effectively murdering blogs.</p>\n    ",

      "description": "Set 17 years after the main events of WE’RE ALIVE, GOLDRUSH is a recollection story that describes the efforts of the “soldiers” (Greg Muldoon, Anthony Robbins, Carl Thomas, and Samuel Puck) attempt a side mission to retrieve a suspected stash of gold bullion.\n\nTold from the perspective of an aging Gen. Puck, he confides this previously undisclosed tale to the only surviving relation of his former team, Alex Robbins, the son of Puck’s friend Anthony. Over the course of ten episodes, the show will not only relate past tales of heroics, horror, and humor, but also sets the stage for future characters.\n\nIn Goldrush, fans will truly get to know these well-beloved characters characters on a much more emotionally satisfying level. Their humor and unique group dynamic certainly remain intact, and modeled after old Spaghetti Westerns, the story takes directions the series has not yet explored.\n\nFilled with action, battles with the undead, love triangles, conflicting loyalties, and of course gold, WE’RE ALIVE: GOLDRUSH stands out as a truly unique Theater for the Mind experience for both new and old listeners.",

Unsolved, a true crime podcast series from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, guides listeners through these real-life mysteries, uncovering new clues along the way.\n\nSeason three of Unsolved tells the story of Father Alfred Kunz, whose throat was slit inside St. Michael School in 1998. Some believe his death was linked to his battles against evil. Others believe his all-too-human flaws were to blame.\n\nSeason two of Unsolved, released in 2017, examines the case of toddler Michelle Manders, who vanished from her bedroom in the middle of the night in 1981. Did she wander alone into the darkness? Or was she kidnapped?\n\nSeason one of Unsolved, released in 2015, explores the circumstances surrounding the death of 14-year-old John Zera, who disappeared from Franklin High School in 1976. The seven episodes follow investigators through decades of dead ends as they hold on to hope of finding the killer.\n\nSubscribe to Unsolved on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher Radio or wherever you get your podcasts.

How did her technology, meant to revolutionize healthcare, potentially put millions of patients at risk? And how did so many smart people get it so wrong along the way? ABC News chief business, technology and economics correspondent Rebecca Jarvis, along with producers Taylor Dunn and Victoria Thompson, take listeners on a journey that includes a three-year-long investigation.

More than 70 years later, it remains America's most infamous unsolved murder. Many believe Dr. George Hodel was the killer, thanks to an investigation by Hodel's own son. But murder is just part of the Hodel family story, one filled with horrifying secrets that ripple across generations.  Now, through never-before-heard archival audio and first-time interviews, the Hodel family opens up to reveal their shocking story.  In this eight-part documentary series, sisters Rasha Pecoraro and Yvette Gentile, the great grand daughters of George Hodel, take a deep dive into their family history to try to figure out what really happened, and where do they all go from here? Root of Evil is the companion podcast to TNTs limited series I Am the Night. Inspired by the true story of the Hodel family, the series stars Chris Pine and comes from acclaimed Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins.",

      "description": "Dan Harris is a fidgety, skeptical ABC News anchor who had a panic attack live on \"Good Morning America,\" which led him to try something he always thought was ridiculous: meditation. He went on to write the bestselling book, \"10% Happier.\" In this podcast, Dan explores happiness (whatever that means) from all angles. Guests include legendary meditation teachers -- from the Dalai Lama to Western masters -- as well as scientists, and even the odd celebrity. But the show also ventures beyond meditation, bringing on leading researchers in areas such as social anxiety, bias, creativity, productivity, and relationships. The animating insight of this show is that the mind is trainable. This is what science is showing us. Mental traits such as happiness, calm, generosity, compassion, and connection are not hardwired, unalterable factory settings; they are, in fact, skills that can be trained. On this show, you'll learn how.",

His books include The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, Waking Up, and Islam and the Future of Tolerance (with Maajid Nawaz). The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence, rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live. \n\nHarris's work has been published in more than 20 languages and has been discussed in The New York Times, Time, Scientific American, Nature, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, and many other journals. He has written for The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Economist, The Times (London), The Boston Globe, The Atlantic, The Annals of Neurology, and elsewhere.\n\nSam Harris received a degree in philosophy from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA.",

      "description": "Radio Free Skaro is possibly the most popular, most prolific and charmingly irreverent (but never irrelevant) Doctor Who podcast around. Since August 2006, hosts Warren (in Vancouver, BC) and Steven (in Edmonton, AB) have provided listeners with their brand of amusing Doctor Who praise and punishment. A year later, Chris (also in Edmonton, AB) was added to the team, and The Three Who Rule were born.\n\nRecommended by Doctor Who Magazine, Radio Free Skaro provides an entertaining and diverting listen for the diehard or casual Doctor Who fan. New episodes usually appear on Sundays, following a loose magazine format of the three hosts discussing the news and events of the past week in the worlds of Doctor Who, Torchwood, and the Sarah Jane Adventures. They have also recorded special commentary podcasts for classic series and new series episodes of Doctor Who along with interviews of some of the brightest of the Doctor Who luminaries. Radio Free Skaro is also the official podcast of Gallifrey One, the world’s largest and longest-running annual Doctor Who convention.",

Featuring interviews with extraordinary individuals, Nobody Told Me! shines light on the shared human experiences that bring us together, and the challenges that serve as catalysts for our greatest growth. Nobody Told Me! combines Jan’s impressive broadcast journalism background with Laura’s unique, millennial perspective.  Driven by a genuine desire to educate and empower, their pioneering platform gives insight into the strategies and secrets of people in all walks of life. Equal parts information and inspiration, Nobody Told Me! brings a personal touch to the interview process.  Together, Jan and Laura are asking the questions that help their listeners get through life’s toughest times.</p>",

      "description": "Over two decades, Dr. Fredric Brandt went from a small dermatology practice in Miami to being Madonna's personal skincare consultant and the go-to for public figures desperate to stave off aging. His clients loved him. Fashion magazines profiled him. But as Brandt continued to build his empire—a best-selling product line, pristine homes in New York and Miami, and an absurd modern art collection—he was slowly becoming addicted to his own product. Popular speculation has it that it was Martin Short's scathing portrayal of a clearly-based-on-Brandt character in the 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' that pushed him to his death, but the truth is far more complicated. From Justine Harman and the team behind 'Broken Harts.'",

My business is beauty, and this podcast allows me to take a deeper look at not only external beauty, but also beauty on a greater scale – the beauty that come from inside each of us. I like conversations that will stretch and challenge me. Some interviews will include hard conversations like infertility, racism and spirituality on many different levels, while others in the 'Act Casual' series may include uncomfortable, yet laughable topics about sex and dating. Obviously, because I am in Nashville and work in the country music industry, you will also find conversations with some of country music’s biggest stars such as Jason Aldean and Dierks Bentley and their wives. Ultimately, I am a curious person who loves learning about why we do what we do as people and why we are all really here.

      "description": "In a not so distant future, due to overwhelming carbon emissions, The Earth is on the brink of becoming uninhabitable. These conditions are made far more horrifying because the available housing shelters (that can produce sustainable air quality) will only be able to house 80% of the world’s total population. To try and save the human race, every person has a government-mandated microchip implanted in their brains to attempt to facilitate the migration of a portion of the population to an underground shelter. In order to decide who gets to be protected and who must stay above ground, the government implements a value scale they have determined based on “usefulness” to future society. If you are valued at a 50 or above, you will be chosen to enter the bunker, and, if not, you must stay above ground and face the end of days. “Neuron” (which acts as both a prestigious brain implant and also a software company) is folded into a sanctioned branch of the government called, “The Ministry of Experience.” Their job now is to develop technologies and software that can replicate the human experience above ground. But what is far more pressing is The Ministry must find a way to reduce the use of resources, or they will run out of all survivable assets before being able to relocate to “Eden” - the one place above ground that might be salvageable in a few years time. Whether Eden will be ready in time remains to be seen, but its existence is literally the last hope for the human race surviving. In a drastic effort to cut emissions and resource usage, “The Oyster” is created. The Oyster is Nirvana - A state absent from the mind while being filled with complete pleasure and bliss. What, then, happens when reality begins to fade and The Oyster is all that remains?\n\nThe Oyster stars Logan Browning (Dear White People and the Perfection), Mamoudou Athie (Jurassic World), Carla Gugino (Haunting of Hill House), Keith David (Greenleaf), Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), Constance Zimmer (House of Cards, UnReal), Andrew Santino (Dave) and more.\n\nCreated by Alex Aldea and Adrienne Schaffler",

He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks.",

      "description": "A lighthearted conversation by  runners about their lives as runners and the issues that are interesting or important to them and guests of the show.  TJM is meant to be a companion to you as you run.  Think of us as your running partners on days when you just need some friends to get you out on an easy run.  The show is composed of 10 segments, one for each mile, and every 10 minutes or so we move on to the next topic, to keep things interesting.  Among the hosts' experience are ten 100-mile finishes, dozens of half and full marathons, plenty of 50-milers, and some speedy 5ks and a BQ (and a handful of DNFs).\n\nYour host, Scotty Kummer is an attorney, doberman owner and quite possibly the most painstakingly average runner known to man.  Scott has stumbled through numerous plus 4 and 5 hour marathons.  He's DNF'ed the 150 mile, 100 mile, 50 mile and marathon distance.  Okay, and he is a member of the Order of the Hrimthurs for having completed the Arrowhead 135, the Tuscobia 160 and the Actif Epica 120K in the same calendar year (more people have walked on the moon) as well as finshed 50+ ultramarathons including several 100 mile races.  He was once kicked out of an ultra runing group due to allegations of cyber-bullying.  He has a habit of offending people by accident while trying to help them.  He is a co-founder of the Flatlander Ultrarunners in Chicagoland which has rapidly grown to over 2000 members.  He came up with the idea for Ten Junk Miles after becoming frustrated with hearing interview after interview of Scott Jurek and deciding that runners needed more: more discussions of bathroom breaks that went wrong, pacer stories from hell, DNF reports, stories of getting lost on the trail and other related matters.\n\nMore at http://www.tenjunkmiles.com",

I'm proud to say that we've spoken to almost everyone from the original creative team (aka \"The Cabinet\") including the man himself: Lin-Manuel Miranda. In addition, I've had cast members from every company, crew members, musicians, creatives, and the hard working people that keep the production alive. I've also had to pleasure of speaking to experts on the show and its history, some of my superfan friends of note, celebrity Ham enthusiasts, and everything in between. \n\nWhen I started this podcast in January of 2016, I could not have imagined the incredible community that has grown around the show and the amazing experiences that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has listened, appeared on the show, contributed, or reached out in any way. This podcast is for you and I absolutely love making it. \n\nIf you have any great Ham stories or funny references that you've come across, let me know! Email TheHamilcast [at] gmail [dot] com, or contact me on social media @TheHamilcast. I also have a Patreon that has given rise to the loveliest corner of the internet, ever. You can learn more about how to be a part of that lovely corner, and how to submit questions to guests, and to be part of my monthly AMA's at https://www.patreon.com/TheHamilcast",

      "description": "Congratulations, you've found the bravest podcast on the Internet! Now, let’s review the facts: there’s no such thing as good art and it’s a red flag for any adult to have a favorite band. Naturally, most of you will disagree with that statement. That's fine. If it helps, pretend the hosts are only playing a drinking game. Some algorithm randomly assigns a band to deconstruct and that's all Mark and Tyler are doing in every episode. Start with an easy one, some band everyone already knows is trash, like The Beatles or The Clash. Laugh along, “Hahaha! So funny... Yes...” With time, though, the realization is inevitable: this is a true crime podcast. Culture is a pyramid scheme and your favorite band is just the soundtrack to a fake vintage t-shirt. (Your favorite t-shirt also sucks, by the way. This podcast sells better shirts at shop.yfbspod.com because we care.) In the end, it all comes down to one question: can you find the inner strength it takes to press play and learn why Your Favorite Band Sucks?\n[REQUESTS? We only take them from subscribers, so smash the button and put that request in a 5-Star Review!] Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/yfbspod/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/yfbspod/support</a>",

One of the most iconic bands in American history, “The Dead” as they are affectionately called by their fans—self proclaimed \"Dead Heads”—have been dogged by a darkness that has followed them since its inception. Despite the Grateful Dead’s ethos of peace and love and communal music, this darkness has led to the murder and the disappearance of some of the band’s most dedicated fans. Hosted by popular podcasters Payne Lindsey of Up and Vanished and Jake Brennan of Disgraceland, this podcast combines the distinct storytelling styles of both Payne's investigative style and Jake’s single-voice narrative style. From Tenderfoot TV and Double Elvis, this is Dead and Gone, a long, strange, deadly trip.New episodes every Thursday",

But in 1990 their music was declared legally obscene, and what followed is known today as the most controversial trial in the history of hip hop. This group, this city and this trial changed the course of music history as we know it.

Hosted by Grammy Award-winner and MacArthur “Genius” Fellow Rhiannon Giddens, Aria Code is produced in partnership with The Metropolitan Opera.\r\n\r\nEach episode dives into one aria — a feature for a single singer — and explores how and why these brief musical moments have imprinted themselves in our collective consciousness and what it takes to stand on the Met stage and sing them.\r\n\r\nA wealth of guests—from artists like Rufus Wainwright and Ruben Santiago-Hudson to non-musicians like Dame Judi Dench and Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl—join Rhiannon and the Met Opera’s singers to understand why these arias touch us at such a human level, well over a century after they were written. Each episode ends with the aria, uninterrupted and in full, recorded from the Met Opera stage.\r\n\r\nAria Code is produced in partnership with WQXR, The Metropolitan Opera and WNYC Studios.",

You don't have to know any philosophy, or even to have read the text we're talking about to (mostly) follow and (hopefully) enjoy the discussion. For links to the texts we discuss and other info, check out www.partiallyexaminedlife.com.\n\nWe also feature episodes from other podcasts by our hosts to round out your partially examined life, including Pretty Much Pop (prettymuchpop.com, covering all media), Nakedly Examined Music (nakedlyexaminedmusic.com, deconstructing songs), and (sub)Text (subtextpodcast.com, looking deeply at lit and film).

We wish we could answer everyone’s question(s), but we’ll do our best to get through as many of them as we can.

All the other stuff, about how memories, thoughts, hopes and dreams are knit into the fabric we create, and so become part of the fabric of our lives; about how life and knitting intertwine, and how sometimes you simply cannot tell where one part leaves off the other begins; about how the only thing wrong with the world today is that there is not enough knitting in it, all that came later, over time. Since 2005 the podcast has evolved to focus on finding inspiration in the ordinary, using it to kick start the process of making stuff, and finding ways to carve out the creative time and space that allows you to work your ass off on the projects that matter most to you. Like knitting a sweater. Or saving the world.",

Get to hear the personal Etsy stories behind your favorite Etsy shops as well as those you haven't yet discovered. it all began when a Turkish classical musician, a graphic designer, and an iPhone newbie/crafting geek all happily collided in the summer of 2013 in a happy conspiracy that birthed the new host and the revival of the Etsy Conversations Podcast. As an iPhone newbie trying to figure out what the funny-looking purple icon on her phone was, Ijeoma discovered a podcast that was in desperate need of life support. A few conversations, emails and two to five petite cups of Turkish apple tea later, the podcast went from the brink of obsolescence to becoming the watercooler hub for all things Etsy, handmade, and arts & crafts-related. The Etsy Conversations Podcast is the home of inspiring interviews with and for veteran and newbie Etsy sellers where you get tips, techniques, and tools to make you a better more successful Etsy seller by learning from other Etsy sellers.

For example, artificially intelligent systems recognize our voices, sort our pictures, make purchasing suggestions, and can automatically fly planes and drive cars. In this podcast series, we examine such questions such as: How do these devices work? Where do they come from? And how can we make them even smarter and more human-like? These are the questions that will be addressed in this podcast series!",

If you are in sales and have a passion for selling you will like this podcast. The focus is on b2b sales and selling. If are selling or in sales this podcast is for you.  Some of the topics I cover are cold calling, spin selling, challenger sale, solution selling, advanced selling skills. strategic selling, linkedin, saas, sales leadership, sales management, social media, b2b marketing, maverick selling method and how sales has changed. If you are in sales and like selling this podcast is for you.\nI have been selling for over 25 years and today I help companies increase revenue and reduce sales cycles by understanding how their customers make purchase decisions. I avoid the old-school tips and trick approach to sales and rather create sales and buying pattern map which enables salespeople to understand the selling and buying pattern. My clients are rewarded with over 300% increase in new business and a 30% reduction in the time it takes to close business. My approach is direct and without the fluff that other sales training companies take so if you want the brutal truth about sales and selling you have found the right place. If you like Tim Ferriss, Bill Burr, Dave Ramsey, Serial, Reply All, The Art of Charm, HBR, WTF, Startup, Motley Fool, Money, Gimlet, TEDTalk, NPR, EOFIRE, The TOP, Ziglar, Salesman red, Hustler, GaryVEE you will like this.",

Journalist Grant Wahl, who covered Freddy and LeBron James in their teens, retraces the legend of Freddy as he went from superstar to one of the biggest \"what ifs,\" asking: What determines who \"makes it\" and who \"doesn't\"? And what does it say about our cultural obsession with the potential of young athletic genius?",

How did the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup save English soccer from falling apart? And how did one player turn a free-kick into an act of protest? This series from Gimlet Media is an homage to the triumph and heartbreak, victory and defeat that we all experience from soccer (or football, or futbol, or whatever you call it). And it reminds us that so much of what we love about the beautiful game happens off the pitch.",

He is from England and teaches meditation, Buddhist philosophy and mindfulness.\n\nYeshe spent several years in a monastery in the foothills of the Himalayas teaching young monks basic Buddhist philosophy and meditation. He now offers teachings freely to all in a manner that is unpretentious and clear. He does not demand students to blindly accept what he says, but instead invites them to examine their own minds and experiences to discover the validity of Gautama Buddha’s teachings. \n\nYeshe quietly demonstrates Gautama Buddha’s teaching on compassion through the charitable trust ‘Sangye Menla’ that he founded in 2008 in Chandigarh, Northern India. The trust provides medical assistance and care to people from the Himalayan region in India.",

      "description": "The Song Celestial unfolds a dialogue of the advice given by an avatar or God incarnate. The recipient of the message is Arjuna, the prototype of the struggling human soul who is ready to receive the great knowledge by his close companionship and increasing nearness to the divine Self within himself. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This symbolic companionship of Krishna and Arjuna, the divine and the human soul is further dramatized by the fact that their dialogue takes place amidst the din and clamor of a battlefield. The teacher in the Gita is therefore not only the God who is transcendent but also the God in man who unveils Himself through an increasing knowledge... <br/>                                                                     Vanamali, Nitya Yoga.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Aldous Huxley, asserts that ‘The Bhagavad Gita occupies an intermediate position between scripture and theology; for it combines the poetical qualities of the first with the clear-cut methodicalness of the second. ‘The book may be described’ writes Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in his admirable Hinduism and Buddhism, ‘as a compendium of the whole doctrine to be found in the earlier Vedas, Brahmanas and Upanishads, and being therefore the basis of all the The later developments, it can be regarded as the focus of all Indian religion...<br/><br/>...But this focus of Indian religion is also one of the clearest and most comprehensive summaries of the perennial philosophy ever to have been made. Hence its enduring value, not only for Indians, but for all mankind’.<br/><br/>The Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) offers an understanding of The Great Mystery, which has inspired many of the giants of the Western intellectual tradition. The transcendentalist poets Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman were students of The Bhagavad Gita. Thoreau wrote: ‘In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous cosmological philosophy of The Bhagavad Gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.’<br/><br/>Emerson, referring to the Gita, wrote: ‘It was the first of books. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age . . . had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.’<br/><br/>This is a series of discourses on the liberating teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) by Mataji (Mother) Vanamali, Vanamali Gita Yogasram, Rishikesh, North India.<br/><br/>Vanamali Mataji is the author of The Lila Hindu World Heritage Library. Her books include: a translation of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Nitya Yoga, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,  Sri Krishna Lila, Sri Rama Lila, Sri Shiva Lila, Sri Devi Lila, Sri Hanuman Lila, Lilas of the Sons of Shiva, Gurudeva  and The Taste Divine. Sri Devi Lila is published in the U.S. as  Shakti: Realm of The Divine Mother , Sri Hanuman Lila  as  Hanuman: The Devotion and Power of The Monkey God.<br/><br/>Each talk is introduced with the Sanskrit invocations and chanting of the Gita chapter. Then Mataji Vanamali offers a line-by-line illumination of Shri Krishna's liberating teachings.<br/><br/>We invite you to visit our website: www.Vanamaliashram.org<br/>and enjoy our Pilgrims Guide, Discourses and Book &amp; Music store.<br/><br/> <br/>",

Each episode is dedicated to either a theme of Jewish history, a great personality of Jewish history, an era of Jewish history, or a transcendent event of our people’s history. We learn about our people’s triumphs and high-points, and of course, our nadirs. The Chosen People have experienced an unprecedented 4,000 year story, and it is gloriously retold in The Jewish History Podcast.

It follows the events during the night of the affluent Billings family annual dinner party with their distinguished, eccentric guests. However, all is not fun and games as shortly after the party starts, a snowstorm begins to rage outside, trapping all the partygoers inside their host’s mansion. When a murderer starts killing off those in attendance, the guests must figure out who is responsible, or at least how to stay alive -- lest they be next.\n\nDeadly Manners was created by Ali Garfinkel and Alex Aldea.\n\nDeadly Manners stars Kristen Bell, Denis O'Hare, Alisha Boe, RuPaul, Anna Chlumsky, Timothy Simons, Michelle Visage, Alona Tal, David Cummings and is narrated by LeVar Burton.\n\nArtwork by Kina Lee.",

      "description": "\n      A show about clinical depression...with laughs? Well, yeah. Depression is an incredibly common and isolating disease experienced by millions, yet often stigmatized by society. The Hilarious World of Depression is a series of frank, moving, and, yes, funny conversations with top comedians who have dealt with this disease, hosted by veteran humorist and public radio host John Moe. Join guests such as Maria Bamford, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Richter, and Jen Kirkman to learn how they’ve dealt with depression and managed to laugh along the way. If you have not met the disease personally, it’s almost certain that someone you know has, whether it’s a friend, family member, colleague, or neighbor. Depression is a vicious cycle of solitude and stigma that leaves people miserable and sometimes dead. Frankly, we’re not going to put up with that anymore. The Hilarious World of Depression is not medical treatment and should not be seen as a substitute for therapy or medication. But it is a chance to gain some insight, have a few laughs, and realize that people with depression are not alone and that together, we can all feel a bit better. American Public Media and HealthPartners’ Make It Okay campaign are committed to breaking the stigma around mental health.\n    ",

But now that I’m getting older (I’m 41 now, yikes), I want to peek inside the heads of real people to learn how they find meaning in life. I’m also very curious what their favorite snack food is, and what emoji they use most often — ya know, the REALLY important stuff. Every episode I’ll get personal with all kinds of people, from actors to musicians to deep thinkers who fascinate me. My brother Christian is on hand each episode to keep me honest, and occasionally remind me about some of the embarrassing things I’ve done over the years. Join us, or if you have more important things to do, that’s okay too — life is short! </p>\n    ",
