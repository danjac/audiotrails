<pubDate>Fri, 10 April 2009 16:11:32 CST</pubDate>

<description>Broadcast in the late 1940s, this adventure series centers around the travels of a tramp steamer called The Scarlet Queen to exotic ports of call in the Pacific. The show's use of the ship's log as a narrative device is reminiscent of Star Trek and may well be where Gene Roddenberry lifted the idea from. The stories themselves are a pleasing mix of swashbuckling Indiana Jones and hard-boiled detective, liberally seasoned with saltwater for flavoring.

In this episode, the ship is chartered for a lucrative voyage, but before she can set sail, the first mate is accused of murder and it is up to the captain to prove his innocence.

<description>SUSPENSE  September 30, 1954 "A Little Matter of Memory" was based on the story by James Helvick.
A couple staying in an isolated cottage return from a walk only to discover a note on their door telling of a dangerous maniac on the loose. Very tense beginning and middle with some quintessential radio drama scenes, but the Third Act problems are nigh insurmountable. Having set the plot in motion, there are only a couple of ways that it can end. But kudos to Norman MacDonnell who produced and directed. Lawrence Dobkin played Edward and Paula Winslowe played Joan. Also appearing were Edgar Barrier, Joseph Kearns, and Richard Peel. James Helvick was a pseudonym for Francis Claud Cockburn (1904-1981), a British journalist and novelist who wrote an interesting book about the phenomenon of the best-selling novel. (He was also the cousin of Evelyn Waugh.)</description>

<description>The background is as interesting as the plot. Who remembered that sixty years ago you could make gramophone records in your own home the way you make CDs today? Here the lead-up to a murder is captured on record by the victim and it's up to Nick Carter to make sense of it all.</description>

<description>One of the rare comical episodes of Suspense. Arthur Ross (writer) Elliott Lewis (director) and guest star Jack Benny combine to give us a whimsical thriller about a talkative small-town nobody who runs into an old acquaintance... who happens to be a bank robber. Jack is soon playing the leading role in a hold-up without knowing it. The robbers' theory is that he's such a boring and unmemorable type that none of the witnesses will even be able to describe him!</description>

<description>This mostly faithful adaption of Edgar Allen Poe's classic tale of intemperance, murder, and supernatural justice features the unmistakable voice talent of Peter Lorre in the starring role. Lorre is at his manic best as he draws the listener along on his journey into madness at the hands--or should we say paws--of a mysterious ebony feline named 'Pluto'.

Mystery In The Air was an limited-run anthology series, which originally aired in the summer of 1947. Each episode featured Peter Lorre in a different spooky or suspenseful tale, "culled from the pages of world literature". Mystery In The Air only ran for eight episodes, but each is an audio gem in its own right.</description>
